//Relational Operator: it is used to find out the relation between two numbers based on certation condition/situation
//Why Relational Operator: for creating condtion.
//Relational Operator always return boolean value either true or false
//Note: they are only applicable for number type value.

//when true or false:
//true: when your condition is matching/correct
//false: when your condition is not  matching/correct

//We've following types of Relational Operator:
//1. > (greater than)
//2. >= (greater than or equal to)
//3. < (less than)
//4. <= (less than or equal to)

//Example: check a number is negative or positive

// var num = 0

// var result = num <= 0
// //true: number is negative
// //false: number is positive
// console.log(result)


//Example: check a person is eligible for vote according to the age.

// var age = 18

// var result = age >= 18
// //true: eligible for vote
// //false: not eligible for vote

// console.log(result)

//Example: 
//true: 1
//false: 0

// var result  = 4>3
// console.log(result) //true

// var finalResult = result>=1
// console.log(finalResult)


//in the case of relational operator, it uses type convertion automatically.
